# DUNE Run Control User Interface (drunc-ui)

This README contains a short summary on getting started with the project. For more
details see the [documentation].

[documentation]: https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/drunc_ui/

This repo defines the web interface for various drunc tools. Including:

- [The Process Manager]
- [The Controllers]

## Running the Project Locally

The DUNE control system comprises multiple services working in concert (see the
[drunc repository] for an overview). Whilst it is possible to manually run the
individual services as required it is strongly recommended to use the Docker setup
provided.

## Docker Setup

This repository provides a Docker Compose configuration providing the requisite services
suitable for development of the interfaces using realistic test data. Working with the
full docker stack requires building a very larger docker base image and has heavy
resource requirements when running. For this reason a "lite" stack is also provided that
can be used for development of the Process Manager UI.

The full and lite stack are defined using [Docker Compose profiles]. It is recommended
to set the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` environment variable to select which stack you are working
with. Use the value `drunc` for the full stack or `drunc-lite` for the lite stack.

You can also use the `--profile` flag when invoking `docker compose` however the
instructions in this file assume you are using the environment variable.

## Process Manager UI

You can use either the full or lite Docker Compose profiles when working with the
Process Manager UI.

### Getting Started with the Process Manager UI

Check you have a value set for `COMPOSE_PROFILES` (see above). Start the docker stack
with:

```bash
docker compose up
```

It can take a few moments for the services to boot but the UI should then be available
in the browser at <http://localhost:8000/process_manager/>.

__Note that if you have the Process Manager UI already open in a browser you may see
backtraces from unsuccessful requests generated by the UI. These should stop once drunc
has finished starting up.__

Authentication is required to work with the application so you need to create a user
account to work with:

```bash
docker compose exec app python manage.py createsuperuser
```

and follow the prompts. You should then be able to use the details you supplied to pass
the login screen. You can use the "boot" button on the main page to create simple
processes to experiment with.

Take the services down with `docker compose down` or by pressing Ctrl+C in the
corresponding terminal.

## Controller UI

You must use the full Docker Compose profile when working with the Controller UI. The
controller UI will not function correctly with the lite profile.

### Getting Started with the Controller UI

Check you have value of the `COMPOSE_PROFILES` variable set to `drunc` (see above). As
with the Process Manager UI start the Docker Compose services and create a user account
if not already done. You can then boot a full test session:

```bash
docker compose exec drunc /boot_test_session.sh
```

_Note that the above consumes several Gb of memory._

The test session boots a full set of processes and controllers suitable for UI testing
and development. Once booted you can view the status of the root controller with the UI
at <http://localhost:8000/controller>.

For details of working with the controller see the [drunc wiki]. You should also be able
to see the booted processes in the Process Manager UI.

#### Note for MacOS users

The above `boot_test_session.sh` will not work on M-series Macs because of limitations
with the x86 architecture emulation used by MacOS. There is a simpler configuration that
can be used instead. To use this, set the following environment variables before
starting the docker containers:

- `CSC_SESSION=lr-session`
- `CSC_URL=drunc:25000`

## Not Using Docker

Brief instructions are provided below on how to manually run the various services
required to work with the Drunc UIs. These are only meant to be indicative however and
are not regularly tested or maintained.

1. Start Kafka - See [Running drunc with pocket kafka].

1. Start the drunc shell:
   `drunc-unified-shell --log-level debug ./data/process-manager-pocket-kafka.json`

1. Start the application server: `python manage.py runserver`

1. Start the Kafka consumer: `python manage.py kafka_consumer --debug`

You may then need to perform subsequent actions such as booting test session data.
